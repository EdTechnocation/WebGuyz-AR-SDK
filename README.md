# WebGuyz-AR-SDK

Download Latest AR SDK from WebGuyz.<BR>
Open in Unity 2018<BR>
Place Trackers and or Image of the tracker (You can just grab any image off google), in a folder called trackers(your images). There is already a sample folder called Trackers, you can use.  (Barcodes and QR codes work too! )<BR>
Inside the Assets folder in the SDK , is a Unity Scene called Markerless AR Demo, this is what you open. <BR>
In Unity , there is nice menu called Tools, we have added some stuff there and deleted all the useless unity stuff that was there previously. You should see the WebGuyz â€œ Augmented Reality Cognitive Optimized Library<BR>
And yes you guessed it, open the Model Manager 1.0 FIRST RELEASE.<BR>
First you will see two MAIN tabs , Barcode and Features.<BR>
